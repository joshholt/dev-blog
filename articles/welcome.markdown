**My Dev Log** is a blog featuring blurbs relating to my attempt at porting SC's build tools to NodeJS.

This article is about my first steps. Hopefully many articles will follow as I journey though SproutCore's buildtools.

## Starting the Port - Study the buildtools. ##

	// TODO: Fill this in after I study some more

## Break the buildtools into workable sections ##
	
	// TODO: Can't do this if I have studied enough :)
	
## Begin Work ##
	
	// Slow down man, wait for the First 2 headings get filled out.

## Off to see the wizzard ##

	// If I only had a brain :^)~
